                Hi, I’m Rishi, a computer science student with a growing passion for web development. I love the creative and problem-solving aspects of building websites and applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.

    I’m currently learning core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring modern frameworks like React and backend tools to expand my skill set. I enjoy experimenting with new ideas, taking on projects that challenge me, and finding innovative ways to solve problems through code.
    I aspire to create digital solutions that make an impact, whether it’s through enhancing user experiences, improving accessibility, or building tools that simplify everyday tasks. My journey in web development is just beginning, and I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and turning my ideas into reality.

                I’m Rishi, a student at Vivekanand Education Society's Polytechnic, where I’m pursuing a diploma in computer science. My time here has been incredibly enriching, as I’ve gained a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and database management. The institution’s focus on practical learning has allowed me to work on hands-on projects that strengthen my technical skills. I’ve also had the opportunity to explore my interest in web development, which has quickly become my passion. The supportive environment and guidance from my mentors have been instrumental in shaping my journey as I strive to build a strong career in the tech industry.
